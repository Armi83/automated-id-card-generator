# Automated ID Card Generator

## Overview
This project automates the generation of ID cards using student data stored in an Excel file. It was developed during my CSSI internship to reduce manual effort and errors in bulk ID card creation.

## Problem Statement
Manually designing and generating ID cards for a large number of students is time-consuming and error-prone. This tool automates the process using structured input data.

## Approach
- Read student details from an Excel file
- Process data using Pandas
- Generate customized ID cards using Pillow (PIL)
- Save ID cards automatically to an output directory

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Pillow (PIL)

## Input
- Excel file containing student details (name, ID, department, etc.)

## Output
- Automatically generated ID card images

## Note
Sample data is used in this repository to demonstrate functionality.
